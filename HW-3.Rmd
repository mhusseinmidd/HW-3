## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: None
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 5 Hours
* What gave you the most trouble: Question 1
* Any comments you have: Question 1 is in a very crude state as it currently stand. 
Would love to discuss the concepts related to machine learning in class. In 
addition, what are the statistical implications for losing a considerable chunk 
of the dataset as a result of the variables chosen and how thresholds are chosen. 


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder).

## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to
predict individual's gender and interpret your results.

  profiles %>%  
  mutate (smc=ifelse(education=="Some College", 1,0), 
          grad=ifelse(education=="Graduate or Professional Degree", 1,0),
          spc=ifelse(education=="Space Camp", 1,0),
          ath=ifelse(body_type=="athletic", 1,0),

          drugs, age, height, log_income)

logistic_model <- 
  glm(is_female ~ age + smc + grad + spc + ath + cur + fit + ff + smokes 
                      + drinks + drugs + height + log_income, family=binomial(), profiles)

panderOptions("digits", 3)
pander (logistic_model, covariate.labels =c("Age", 'Some College', 
                                            'Graduate/ Professional Degree',
                                            'Space Camp', 'Atheltic', 'Curvey', 
                                            'Fit', 'Full Figured', 'Smokes',
                                            'Drinks', 'Does Drugs', 'Height', 
                                            'Logged Income'))
```

The results of our regression model show that age is a statistically significant predictor of sex. A one year increase in age, on average, is associated with a 1.021 increase in the odds of being female. Conversely, having only some college education, compared to having a Bachelor's, decreases the odds of being female by 0.802. Ideally. we would be able to see the condifence interval for these predictions, but the code breaks down. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# Have to fix this somehow ... 
# ci_logistic_model <-confint (logistic_model)
# pander (ci_logistic_model)
```

### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
profiles <- profiles %>% 
            mutate (fitted_probability=fitted(logistic_model))

hist(fitted(logistic_model))
```

### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

The contingency table below displays predicted and actual sexes of Okcupid users in the Bay Area. Overall, our model seems to have fared quite well. Of the 6,742  males in our sample, we were able to predict accuratley the sex of 6,043. That is, our model correctly predicted the gender of males 90% of the time. As for females, the model predicted correctly their sex 83.7% of the time. Combined, our model made correct predictions 88.3% of the time regarding an Okcupid user's sex. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
profiles <- profiles %>% 
  mutate (predicted_sex_logodds=predict(logistic_model), 
          
          #Find the odds: 
          
          predicted_sex_odds=exp(predicted_sex_logodds), 
          
          #Now, convert to probability: 
          
          predicted_sex_prob=predicted_sex_odds/(1+predicted_sex_odds), 
          
          #We have the probability that someone is female based on our model. Now, we incorporate the threshold: 
          
          predicted_sex=ifelse(predicted_sex_prob>=0.5, 1, 0)
          )

profiles$is_female <- factor(profiles$is_female, levels = c(0, 1),
labels = c("Male", "Female"))

colnames <- c("Predicted Male", "Predicted Female")
#We can compare actual sex to predicted sex: 
compare <- table(profiles$is_female, profiles$predicted_sex)
kable (compare, col.names=colnames
       )
```


### d)

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

False positive refers to instances of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis. In this case, it refers to predicting that a user is female when in fact they are male. As it currently stands, the model has a false positive rate of 17.3% only. In general, however, if we wanted to adjust a threshold tp get such a rate, I have no idea what we should do ... (need to think more about this) 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
```

## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()

time_series <- 
  jukebox %>%  
  mutate (date_fixed=parse_date_time(date_time, '%m %d %h:%m:%s %y'), 
          week=floor_date(date_fixed, "week")
  ) %>% 
group_by(week) %>% 
  tally()

ggplot(time_series, aes(x=week, y=n)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x="Week of Year", 
      y="Total Number of Played Songs",
      title="Number of Played Songs per Week")
```

Looking at the graph, it seems that the beginning and end of every year witnesses
a considerable increase in the total number of songs played per week at Reed's 
college. This pattern is expected, since there are presuemably fewer students 
in the summer and during winter break, when the number of songs played is lowest, 
compared to the academic year which spans from September to May.   

## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
graveyard <- 
  jukebox %>% 
  mutate (date_fixed=parse_date_time(date_time, '%m %d %h:%m:%s %y')) %>% 
  filter(month(date_fixed)>=05 & month(date_fixed)<=09) %>% 
  filter (hour(date_fixed)>=00 & hour(date_fixed)<=08) %>%  
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  tally() %>%
  arrange (desc(n)) %>% 
  slice (1:10)

pander(graveyard)
```

The top artist played at Reed college's pool hall on the jukebox 
between 2004 and 2009 is OutKast. The hip-hop duo beats its closest contester
The Beatles by a considerable margin of 149. The Beatles, in turn, was played 
132 times more than Radiohead, who came in third place, overtaking Led Zeppelin
by merely 10 times. Eminem, who took the tenth place, can perhaps learn a lesson 
or two from OutKast, who were played 463 times more than the contemporary rapper. 

## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

A visual comparison between the prices of bitcoin and gold relative to the US 
dollar shows that, in the long term, gold is characterized by mild fluctuations. 
More specifically, the amplitude of the volatity of gold is around 417 USD.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, seems to possess a maximum displacement of 600 USD, 
making it more volatile than gold over all. This large difference of almost 200 USD
is driven in part by a drastic spike in the value of Bitcoins in the week of 
29-11-2013, when its media presence was strong, as evident by references in 
articles in CNN Money, Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg. From Mid-2014 onwards, 
it seems that the fluctuations of Bitcoin have become milder and continue to look 
this way up to the present. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

gold<- Quandl("WGC/GOLD_DAILY_USD", start_date="2010-07-17") %>% 
  tbl_df()


bitcoin_gold <- 
  left_join(bitcoin, gold, by="Date") %>%  
  select (Date, `24h Average`, Value)

q4 <- 
  ggplot(bitcoin_gold, aes(Date)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `24h Average`, colour = "Bitcoin")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = Value, colour = "Gold"))+ 
  labs(x="Year", 
       y="Average Price Per Day", 
       title="Price Volatility of Gold and Bitcoin") 
ggplotly(q4)
```

## Question 5:

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
